	Abstract = {Mashups are an exciting genre of new Web applications that gained considerable momentum, recently. While thousands of mashup applications exist and many software vendors promote ``Enterprise Mashup'' suites, the term ``mashup'' itself lacks concise definition and the usefulness of mashups in specific fields of operation remains unclear. 

In this work, 29 mashups and tools to create mashups have been studied in a qualitative survey that revealed two general types and eight common characteristics of mashups. This survey forms the basis of a general mashup pattern that specifies mashups by their characteristic behavior of aggregating capabilities on the Web. A reference model, complying with this pattern, provides means to understand existing and design new mashups on a conceptual level.
In a further step, this knowledge has been used to examine the suitability of mashups in the field of business process management. Specific application scenarios were analyzed comprehensively on the basis of the business process life cycle, revealing significant potential aggregating fragmented process knowledge and providing lightweight process implementations.},

	Abstract = {Collaboration processes are generally coordinated without an explicit notion of a guiding process. Even though this kind of work is performed in a rather structured manner, explicit software support to coordinate these processes is rare. On the other hand, process automation is mainly considered for highly frequent processes, due to the cumbersome setup of adequate systems and the process implementation effort.

This paper presents a mashup that effectively coordinates humans who strive for a collaborative goal. Participants can design and enact their processes right away; a lightweight process execution engine automatically coordinates participants through correlated messages. In contrast to classic mashups, we turn the architecture upside down and orchestrate Web applications and their respective service APIs. 
A process map, similar to classic mapping mashups, gives insight into the current state of a process and its activities as well as information that is required to evaluate and trace process history.},

Repositories containing hundreds or thousands of process models are not uncommon, whereas only simplistic search functionality, such as text based search or folder navigation, is provided, today.

On the other hand, advanced methods have recently been proposed in the literature to ascertain the similarity of process models. However, due to performance reasons, an exhaustive similarity search by pairwise comparison is not feasible in large process model repositories. 

This paper presents an indexing approach based on metric trees, a hierarchical search structure that saves comparison operations during search with nothing but a distance function at hand. A detailed investigation of this approach is provided along with a quantitative evaluation thereof, showing its suitability and scalability in large process model repositories.},

organizations are represented by process models. It is an
important task in any process improvement project, yet 
time consuming and error prone. While many
organizations maintain large process model repositories, we
observe that the information these repositories carry is not fully
exploited during process modeling. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to business process design called Design by
Selection, which takes advantage of process repositories during
design and facilitates reuse of process model components. These
components can be static or flexible. Static ones represent the
specific aspects of the process model, while flexible components
realize re-use: They are defined by visual queries, which
return matching process model components to be embedded in the
overall process.  Thus, process models can be designed in a more
efficient, higher quality, and less error-prone way.},

We observed that many business processes are modeled redundantly consuming a lot of money and resources. Collecting, sharing, and re-using process models overcome this problem. Libraries in the real world are a good example of sharing resources among many members reducing the relative cost of each item. 

In the same way we propose to collect, share, and exchange process models in a process library. This paper introduces the requirements, design and implementation for a process library with a use case from the public sector in its initial phase that allows collecting, sharing, and exchanging process models within or across public administrations. Building onto this, we propose challenging research opportunities in the field of process model libraries.},

Their effective utilization requires meaningful and efficient capabilities to search for models that go beyond text based search or folder navigation, e.g., by similarity. Existing measures for process model similarity are often not applicable for efficient similarity search, as they lack metric features.
In this paper, we introduce a proper metric to quantify process similarity based on behavioral profiles. It is grounded in the Jaccard coefficient and leverages behavioral relations between pairs of process model activities. The metric is successfully evaluated towards its approximation of human similarity assessment.},

	With this paper, we outline a research agenda for investigating the act of process modeling using models of the BPM Academic Initiative. This collection comprises 1903 models, the majority captured in BPMN. The models were created by students from various universities as part of their process modeling education. As such, the collection is particularly suited to investigate modeling practice since it is probably unique in terms of modeling heterogeneity. 
As a first step, we characterize EPC and BPMN models of the collection using established process model metrics. Further, we investigate the usage of language constructs for these models. Our findings largely confirm the results obtained in prior, smaller studies on modeling in a professional context.},

However, due to their heterogeneity, extracting and analyzing process models from process model collections is a tedious task and time consuming. 

To facilitate access to process model collections, this paper presents an extensible platform for their analysis that shall support researchers and foster collaboration and reuse.

Typically, hundreds or thousands of models are stored in business process repositories. Effective capabilities to manage and, in particular, search are required to leverage  stored business process models. 

Yet, search remains a challenge, because business processes cannot easily be compared. Existing approaches to process similarity do not support queries that are significantly smaller than sought models and contain only few, yet important, aspects.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to behavioral similarity search that is sensitive to local behavior inclusion, i.e., it will feature models that contain the behavior of a query. This is achieved by comparing local behavioral relationships of a query model with global relationships of candidate models. We present the formal foundation of this approach, derive a  similarity measure, and illustrate the applicability of our approach, also with respect to complexity.},
